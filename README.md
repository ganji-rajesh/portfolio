# About
I leverage a robust skillset in data analysis and machine learning to build data-driven solutions. My expertise includes Python programming (with libraries like pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow for deep learning and spaCy for NLP), advanced SQL querying, and data visualization with Tableau and Power BI (including DAX). I also utilize AWS cloud services to deploy and scale my projects. This allows me to effectively analyze data, develop predictive models, and communicate insights through compelling visualizations.
